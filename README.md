## Task 1: ParkQwik App Evaluation

As part of the internship evaluation, I reviewed the ParkQwik app and provided feedback on its UI/UX and potential improvements. The review was based on:
- Overall impression of the appâ€™s design and usability.
- Identification of usability issues and areas for improvement.
- Suggestions for enhancements or additional features.

*Note: Due to OTP verification issues, the review was based on the ParkQwik website.*
